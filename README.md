# weather_app_flutter

This app was developed in conjunction with a Flutter course on Udemy. I made small improvements in the project created by the instructor in the course and I am sharing it here. Below you can find the images of the project.

## App in a Real Device

As can be seen at the end of the gif image, when we tried to capture the weather in our location again, it gave an error. Although I tried hard on this error, I could not find the reason. Maybe it's a case with the Geolocator package. When the application gave an error in this way, when I turned the gps off and on, surprisingly, it brought the data according to the location information again.

⛔ If you are going to work on this project, you must fill in the "Weather Api Key" part defined at the top of the weather.dart file.
